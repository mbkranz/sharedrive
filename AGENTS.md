## Goal

Build and evolve reusable shared-drive adapters (SharePoint, Google Drive, S3-oriented retrieval workflows).

Goal is to create a quick and efficient system like git and uv both for quick development (so retrieve one or a group of files) with CLI, for more complex workflows (ETL etc)  that will use python API, and emphasis on standardized metadata to build a catalog of resources that can be easily searched and retrieved by users and agents. Currently, the DataPackage standard is followed for metdata (https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/tree/main/profiles) but this may evolve as we iterate on the metadata structure and retrieval patterns (for example: see Issue #4 for OpenMetadata standard)

## Fast context

- Read the code! The best way to understand the current state and patterns is to read through the existing code, especially the clients, auth strategies, and CLI.

- Also equally important! Study the REST APIs for the clients and authorizations:
    - Drive: 
        - /fetch https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/onedrive?view=graph-rest-1.0
    - Sharepoint:
        - 
    - Google drive: 
        - /fetch https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3
        - /fetch https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files
        - /fetch https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/drives


-  And equally important is to use metadata standards. Study these:
    - standard data package (/fetch https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/tree/main/profiles)
    - and see recipes for using (/fetch https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/tree/main/content/docs/recipes)
    - And OpenMetadata for drive services and where else applicable:
        - data assets and storage: /fetch https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadataStandards/tree/main/docs/data-assets/storage
        - and see docs overall here: /fetch https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadataStandards/tree/main/docs
## Preferred commands


- Install (CLI tool): `uv tool install .`
- Run scripts: `uv run python <script-path>`
- Lint: `uv run ruff check .`
- Format: `uv run ruff format .`
- Tests: `uv run pytest`
- Safe retrieval dry-run for CLI: `uvx sharedrive <subcommands and options> --dry-run`

## Development guardrails

- Do not hard-code secrets or tenant-specific values.
- Keep `.env-sample` synchronized with variables read in code.
- Adhere to the [Zen of python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) even if refactoring and reorganization is needed but ensure breaking changes in the cli function commands are noted.
- Always check and analyze the current codebase and the associated API documentation (for example, see Sharepoint and Google URLs in "Fast Context") for services when thinking about answers in terms of better solution 
- Don't be afraid to highlight any concerns with assumptions made in prompts.
- **Type Strictness**: Prefer explicit strict typings (e.g., precise property definitions and `typing.cast`) over deep nested Pydantic validation when simple internal structural typing suffices and performance/clarity is prioritized.
- **Enforcing Interfaces**: Strictly uphold `abstractmethod` signatures across all foundational components (e.g., `BaseClient` and `ServiceItem`). Constantly ensure any mock or dummy classes within the test suite (like `_Item`) are fully updated with stub implementations to prevent abstract instantation failures.
- **Safe Patching (For Agents and Scripts)**: When automatically refactoring Python files—especially Pydantic models—avoid destructive `sed` or naive line-counting patches. Rely on precise string replacements and validate immediately via `uv run pytest` to catch collection or `ImportError` regressions early.

## When updating adapters

- Give warnings and ask for approval before breaking backward compatibility.
- Raise explicit exceptions with actionable error messages.
- Keep network calls and auth behavior obvious and testable.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes (especially URL parsing and download/export logic).


## Documentation rule

- Document any non-obvious behavior in docstrings and `README.md`.
- Update docs if any changes with: `uv run update_docs_markdown.py`
- the __all__ variable is used to explicitly declare public API for each module. When adding new functions or classes that are intended to be part of the public API, make sure to include them in the __all__ list at the end of the module. This helps with clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
- Document design choices through doc strings. For example, the logic and source (like url and name of standard(s) or existing software like uv/git etc that provided either motivation of why property names were used)
